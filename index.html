    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>
      Welcome to my passion project, a free colour picker and colour palette generator! I decided to
      make this site after becoming frustrated with the resources currently available. It felt like
      everything was too expensive, covered in ads, or way too difficult to learn.
    </p>
    <h3>Why does the site look like this?</h3>
    <p>
      This site is currently in development. Things will start looking different over the next few
      weeks.
